# React App Template

My own "create react app" with a stack that I find works well, is easy to
understand, and doesn't need to be ejected in order to get into its guts
and figure out why it isn't working if something comes up.

- Framework: [React](https://react.dev/)
- Typings: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - _OPTIONAL_: The template includes examples with/out typings.
- Styling: Pure CSS styles
  - Simply import your `.css` files into modules that use them.
  - Use the `classnames` package (`import classnames from 'classnames'`) to combine classes.
- Test runner: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- Testing framework: [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
  - All the tools come through the "global" `import { ... } from 'testingUtility'` module which
    can be imported from anywhere (path is aliased in Jest config).
  - Includes [jest-dom](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-jest-dom) extensions.
- Lint: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
  - Configured for the browser in `/src`, for Jest in `/src/**/__tests__` directories, and for
    node everywhere else.
  - Using the latest (currently `es2024`) syntax.
- Formatting: [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- Bundling: [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

## Usage

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `npm run eject -- DEST_DIR` to copy this project (less ignored paths in `./.gitignore`) into a new directory.
3. In this new directory:
    - Git already initialized
    - Dependencies already installed
    - Update the `name`, `version`, `description`, `author`, `license`, and other fields in `package.json`
    - Run with `npm start`

## Running

Using the latest stable version of Node (v20) and NPM (v9.6)...

```bash
# installs all dependencies
$ npm install
# opens a browser to localhost:3000
# set PORT=XXXX in env to run on a different port
$ npm start

# formats the code using Prettier
$ npm fmt
# builds the production bundle
$ npm build
# builds the development bundle
$ npm build:dev
```

> ðŸ’¬ If your browser doesn't open, please open it manually to `localhost:3000`

## Testing

```bash
# checks formatting, linting, build, and tests
$ npm test
# runs unit tests only
$ npm run test:unit
# full format check (style, lint, typings)
$ npm run lint
# runs Prettier in verification mode only
$ npm run fmt:check
# formats the code and then checks for lint errors
$ npm run verify
```

## Styles

Pure CSS: Just `import './MyComponent.css'` in your component's module. The styles will get loaded when/if ever the module is loaded at runtime.

See `./src/components/App/App.js` for an example.
